# stopwatch
Stopwatch app with windows10-like appearance. It can start/stop and reset the time and record laps.
The code (html, css and js) is a complete mess and the app is not responsive. I'm constantly trying to refactor/optimize the code as I learn new things. For now, it just works. Give it a try!
